Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?

If given more time, I would refine the submission by incorporating additional features for an even more robust platform. Specifically, I would focus on implementing separate pages for various products, integrating a user-friendly filter and search bar, and adding a secure payment option to enhance the overall user experience. Additionally, I would allocate time to fine-tune the design for optimal mobile responsiveness and strengthen security measures further. I would also consider adding features like user accounts for personalization, a feedback section, and promotional elements to attract and retain customers. With extended time, I could ensure each enhancement is meticulously implemented, resulting in a more comprehensive and polished solution
